      <h1>About The Hospital</h1>

      <article>
        <p>
          The MARS Wildlife Hospital is open every day of the year, from 9am to
          5pm. In the busy summer season, these hours are often extended as
          volunteers work around the clock to care for the orphaned wildlife.
          Please call 250-337-2021 for hospital support.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>
          You are Mountaire Avian Rescue Society. Do you rescue more than birds?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes we do! While about 3/4 of our patients are birds, we rescue and
          rehabilitate other wildlife. Look here for a sample of our patients
          from January to September 2024.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>What animals do you rehabilitate?</h3>
        <p>
          We rehabilitate almost all wildlife, including birds, mammals,
          amphibians and reptiles. We are not equipped or permitted to
          rehabilitate cougars, bears, and adult deer/elk. If you find one of
          these animals in distress, please call the BC Conservation Service at
          1-877-952-7277.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Do you admit injured, orphaned, or ill non-native/invasive species?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes, we are permitted to have them in care, but not release them. We
          evaluate each case individually. In some cases euthanasia is the best
          option, in other cases we may transfer to another facility.
        </p>
      </article>

        <h3>Do you rehabilitate deer?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, we rehabilitate deer. In fact, MARS has one of the largest deer
          rehabilitation programs in BC. However, we can only accept deer when
          they are young fawns with spots. We are not able to rehabilitate adult
          deer for a couple of reasons:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Adult deer are very high stress animals. In captivity they will
            eventually succumb to a muscle degenerative condition called
            “capture myopathy”, which is induced by the stress of rescue,
            transport, restraint, and confinement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adult deer can be very dangerous due to their large size and
            strength. When they are frightened, they tend to kick and thrash and
            can cause serious injury to their rescuers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you find an injured adult deer, please call the BC Conservation
          Service at 1-877-952-7277 so that the animal may be assessed by a
          Conservation Officer and humanely euthanized if necessary.

        <h3>
          Do you feed admitted animal patients to other patients or ambassador
          birds?
        </h3>
        <p>No, we do not.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Do you accept food donations?</h3>
        <p>
          We are grateful for donations of food to support wildlife
          rehabilitation, but we can only accept certain foods depending on our
          patients’ needs and our ability to store the food. Please refer to the
          list on our Hospital Wish List page.
        </p>

        <h3>How is the hospital staffed?</h3>
        <p>
          We have three full-time professional wildlife rehabilitators at the
          MARS Wildlife Hospital who supervise animal care and hospital
          operations. Each year, we also apply for the federal Canada Summer
          Jobs grant which can allow us to hire additional staff for the season.
          Our team mainly consists of a diverse group of dedicated volunteers
          and work experience students who do everything from washing kennels to
          data entry!
        </p>

        <h3>Can I volunteer at the Wildlife Hospital?</h3>
        <p>
          We are always looking for volunteers to help out at the MARS Wildlife
          Hospital. Check out our volunteer page to learn about the requirements
          and duties associated with each volunteer position. We also accept
          work experience students who live on site from several weeks to
          several months.

        <h3>Do you have veterinarians on staff?</h3>
        <p>
          We do not have vets on staff at MARS, but we work with local vet
          clinics to provide advanced medical care to our wildlife patients.
          These include Campbell River Vet and Country Animal Hospital. We are
          very grateful for their services and expertise, which are often
          donated!

        <h3>
          How do I get an update on an animal that was admitted to the MARS
          Wildlife Hospital?
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you bring an animal to the MARS Wildlife Hospital, you will be
          given the animal’s case number. For updates, please call the Hospital
          main line at 250-337-2021 and leave a message. We receive a high
          volume of calls and have to prioritize wildlife emergencies, but we
          will return your call as soon as we can.

        <h3>Can I visit a patient at the MARS Wildlife Hospital?</h3>
        <p>
          The MARS Wildlife Hospital and recovery enclosures are not open to
          visitors. Wild animals generally do not find human contact comforting
          and we do our best to provide them with a safe, natural, and peaceful
          environment in which to grow, rest, and recuperate. If you want to see
          wildlife up close, we would love the opportunity to take you on a tour
          of our Visitor Centre, where you can meet some of the MARS
          ambassadors!
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Where do you release wildlife?</h3>
        <p>
          When a patient recovers, we usually try to return them to the area
          where they were found because they will be familiar with resources in
          their territory and may even have family waiting for them! If
          returning them to the immediate area is not appropriate, we will look
          for a suitable habitat nearby.

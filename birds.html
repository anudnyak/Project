        <h2>Window Strikes</h2>

        <p>Did you hear that thunk?</p>
        <p>A bird hit your window!</p>

        <h3>How does MARS know window strikes are a problem?</h3>
        <p>Our data tells the story:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>2020: 90 window strike patients</li>
          <li>2021: 151 window strike patients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Over 15 million birds are killed yearly in Canada from window
          collisions.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do birds fly into windows?</h3>
        <p>
          Stand outside and look at your windows. You’ll see a reflection of the
          trees and sky. Doesn’t that look like the perfect place to fly to? You
          understand that glass is hard, but birds don’t – and they don’t get a
          second chance, unless we give them one.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I know if a bird has hit my window?</h3>
        <p>
          Unless you hear or see the collision, you may not know. Half of bird
          strikes leave no trace.
        </p>
        <h3>Can a bird just ‘shake it off’?</h3>
        <p>
          After a collision, birds may fly off with severe injuries which
          eventually kill them or leave them vulnerable to predators.
          Concussions, broken bones, and soft tissue injuries can be treated by
          professional rehabbers.
        </p>

        <h3>What do I do if a bird hits my window?</h3>
        <p>
          Gently put the injured bird in a lidded box with a tea towel ‘donut’
          to support its body. Contact MARS or your nearest wildlife rehab.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I prevent window strikes?</h3>
        <p>
          Mark your windows! Follow these general rules to save birds’ lives:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply treatment to the outside of the window.</li>
          <li>
            Ensure gaps are less than 5 cm (2”) and cover the whole window.
          </li>
          <li>
            Markings must be at least 6mm (¼”) in diameter and have high
            contrast with the window.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Feeding Birds</h2>

        <p>
          We get a lot of questions from the public about putting up bird
          feeders. The persistence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)
          in our area–and across the continent–makes answering this question
          more complicated than usual. Feeders change bird behaviour. Birds can
          gather in unnatural concentrations at feeders and diseases like
          salmonella and conjunctivitis (pink eye) can transfer without proper
          cleaning routines. Songbirds are considered low risk for HPAI but can
          transmit the disease to domestic poultry and other wild birds.
        </p>

        <h3>In Brief</h3>
        <p>
          If you do decide to feed wild birds, commit to providing the right
          food in the right place with protection against hazards like
          predators, windows collision, and disease.
        </p>

        <h3>Should I put up seed and suet feeders?</h3>

        <h4>LOCATION</h4>
        <p>
          If you are near the ocean or waterways where waterfowl, raptors, and
          corvids (crows, ravens, jays) are found, consider not feeding birds
          this year as these are the most common places and species affected by
          HPAI. If you are near chicken or turkey farms, protect your neighbours
          by not feeding wild birds.
        </p>
        <h4>HABITAT</h4>
        <p>
          Does your yard naturally provide food (berries, seeds, insects on the
          ground and in the air) and places to roost and escape predation?
          Feeders should be supplemental, not primary sources of food.
        </p>

        <h4>CLEANLINESS</h4>
        <p>
          How will your food stay dry in wet weather? Will you wash and
          disinfect the feeder weekly with a 10% bleach solution? Will you make
          sure the feeder is fully rinsed and dried before filling? Will you
          rake/wash under your feeders to prevent fecal-borne disease?
        </p>
        <h4>FOOD CHOICE</h4>
        <p>
          Stick to quality seeds like black sunflower seed or Nyjer seed. Watch
          for fillers like corn in lower-cost bird food. Don’t offer bread,
          salted nuts, or use salted fat in suet feeders. Consider separating
          the different types of food offered to decrease interaction between
          different species.
        </p>

        <h4>CONSISTENCY</h4>
        <p>
          Will you be around to fill and wash the feeder every week, or take it
          down during an outbreak of disease such as salmonella?
        </p>
        <h4>PROTECTION</h4>
        <p>
          Cats - Rats - Splats - Traps: If you have free-roaming cats, how will
          you protect wild birds? How will you prevent rats from eating your
          suet and seed? How will you help birds avoid your windows? Bird
          feeders should be placed less than one metre or more than 10 metres
          away from buildings to minimize the risk of collision. Is there any
          danger of entanglement around your feeder from netting or decor?
        </p>
        <h3>Should I put up hummingbird feeders?</h3>

        <h4>LOCATION</h4>
        <p>
          These feeders are a low risk of HPAI transmission and can stay up if
          well cared for.
        </p>

        <h4>HABITAT</h4>
        <p>
          Hummers eat a lot of insects. Nectar gives energy but insects provide
          protein. Is your yard free of pesticides and full of insects and
          spiders?
        </p>
        <h4>NECTAR</h4>
        <p>
          The recipe is 1 part white sugar dissolved in 4 parts water, served in
          small doses so it doesn’t spoil. No honey, brown sugar, organic sugar,
          raw sugar, artificial sweeteners or food dye. Keep extra nectar
          refrigerated.
        </p>

        <h4>CLEANLINESS</h4>
        <p>
          Will you rinse your feeder regularly, scrub and clean with a 10%
          bleach solution weekly? Will you make sure the feeder is fully rinsed
          and dried before refilling? The bacteria that grow in the feeder
          digest the sugar and other pathogens grow over time.
        </p>
        <h4>CONSISTENCY</h4>
        <p>
          Will you be around to fill and wash the feeder? How will you keep it
          from freezing in a cold snap?
        </p>

        <h4>PROTECTION</h4>
        <p>
          Cats - Splats - Traps: If you have free-roaming cats, how will you
          protect hummingbirds? How will you help birds avoid window collisions?
          Is there any danger of entanglement around your feeder from netting or
          decor?

        <h2>Stewardship</h2>
        <p>
          We all love birds and enjoy seeing them around our homes. Whether or
          not we offer food at feeders, we can create conditions for wildlife to
          feed on a diverse diet of insects, berries, and seeds, have trees and
          shrubs in which to perch, seek shelter, and nest. Your stewardship can
          provide the opportunity for you to view birds and at the same time
          protect them from collisions with windows, cat attack, entanglement in
          netting, injury from lawnmowers, nest loss from pruning, or disease
          spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          We welcome your questions. Consider downloading the free Merlin Bird
          ID app to identify birds in your backyard and at your feeder. If you
          find an animal in distress, don’t touch: wait, watch, and call 250
          337-2021. We are happy to support you and the wildlife in our
          community.

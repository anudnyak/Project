        <h2>Become a Member</h2>
        <p>
          A MARS membership is a great way of getting a little bit more involved
          with the MARS Wildlife Rescue Centre. It’s a way of saying you care
          and shows you are willing to step up and make your support concrete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Membership entitles you to attend the Annual General Meeting held each
          year in May. You can help elect MARS board members and vote on the
          principles and policies that guide the MARS Wildlife Rescue Centre.
          You will also receive our eNewsletter. Having a strong membership base
          also helps demonstrate our organization’s support in the community
          when we apply for grants.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most of all, you will be helping us to help wildlife on northern
          Vancouver Island. Your fee goes towards the care and rehabilitation of
          injured, ill or orphaned wildlife.
        </p>

        <p>
          Memberships are renewed every February by end month. New memberships
          taken out after October 1st will be valid for one year after the
          following February.

        <h2>Become a Volunteer</h2>

        <h3>Did you know?</h3>
        <p>
          … MARS Wildlife Rescue depends almost exclusively on volunteers? It’s
          true. There are over 100 volunteers working at MARS, filling every
          position imaginable.
        </p>

        <h3>Work With and For Wildlife</h3>

        <h4>Wildlife Hospital Volunteers</h4>
        <p>
          At the Wildlife Hospital, we have positions for wildlife caregivers,
          ambassador bird caregivers, housekeeping volunteers, and
          transportation volunteers. We also accept work experience volunteers.
          We literally could not treat the 1000+ patients annually without the
          generosity of all these individuals. And of course, even if you’ve had
          no experience working in a wildlife hospital setting, our professional
          wildlife rehabbers will teach you what to do.
        </p>

        <h4>Visitor Centre Volunteers</h4>
        <p>
          At the Visitor Centre, we are seeking gift shop volunteers, and people
          from all walks of life to work with the education and interpretive
          tours. We also depend on volunteers for on-going habitat stewardship
          and property development. We are looking for people with special
          skills: gardeners, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, heavy-duty
          machinery operators, labourers, and shovelers, too. We also have a
          cohort of people working off-site to raise money for MARS through park
          trail maintenance.
        </p>

        <h4>Other</h4>
        <p>Or perhaps you have a skill we didn’t even know we needed!</p>

        <p>
          So why not give it a go, join us, and share in this incomparable
          opportunity to be in service to wild nature. We look forward to your
          application.

        <h2>Work Experience Program</h2>

        <p>
          Mentorship and education are among our core guiding principles at
          MARS. As a result, every year the MARS Wildlife Hospital offers young
          aspiring wildlife rehabilitators an opportunity to gain hands on
          experience working with injured, ill or orphaned wildlife.
        </p>

        <p>
          We accept work experience volunteers all year round. These are
          full-time unpaid positions filled on a rotating basis of anywhere from
          two weeks to several months, depending on your availability.
        </p>
        <h3>What to Expect</h3>
        <p>
          The Wildlife Hospital is staffed by a wildlife rehabilitation manager,
          assistant wildlife rehabilitation manager, a wildlife rehabilitator,
          and many dedicated volunteers. As a work experience volunteer you will
          become part of a team of like-minded people and will be treated with
          respect and friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can expect to be involved in all aspects of the rehabilitation
          process, although your main responsibilities will be diet preparation,
          feeding, and cleaning. You will also participate in animal rescues and
          releases, treatment administration, building projects, grounds
          maintenance, and our community outreach program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spring, summer, and early autumn are considered “Baby Season”. This is
          when we receive the greatest number of patients. We care for many diff
          erent species of wildlife native to Vancouver Island, including
          songbirds, raptors, waterfowl, fawns, raccoons, and other small
          mammals. Be forewarned, work at the Wildlife Hospital can be very
          demanding! In the summer, our volunteer caregivers typically work
          varying shifts between 7 am – 10 pm, with occasional night feedings.
          The schedule can be intense, but you will also be given time off to
          enjoy the beautiful scenery of Vancouver Island.
        </p>
        <p>
          MARS off ers very basic housing, linens, cooking utensils, and
          bicycles for student use. You are responsible for you own food and
          meals, which you can plan on your own or coordinate with other
          students!
        </p>

        <p>
          We accept work experience volunteers from all over the world, with a
          variety of diff erent educational backgrounds. You must be at least 19
          years of age and have a current Tetanus vaccination. We do not require
          our work experience volunteers to have any previous wildlife
          knowledge, nor do they have to be students. Come here prepared to give
          100% to our wild patients and you will have an extraordinary
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are interested in volunteering with us to learn about and care
          for a variety of diff erent wildlife species, MARS might be the
          perfect place for you!

      <h1>Get Involved</h1>
      <h2>Become a Member</h2>
      <p>
        A MARS membership is a great way of getting a little bit more involved
        with the MARS Wildlife Rescue Centre. It’s a way of saying you care and
        shows you are willing to step up and make your support concrete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Membership entitles you to attend the Annual General Meeting held each
        year in May. You can help elect MARS board members and vote on the
        principles and policies that guide the MARS Wildlife Rescue Centre. You
        will also receive our eNewsletter. Having a strong membership base also
        helps demonstrate our organization’s support in the community when we
        apply for grants.
      </p>

      <p>
      Most of all, you will be helping us to help wildlife on northern Vancouver Island. Your fee goes towards the care and rehabilitation of injured, ill or orphaned wildlife.
      </p>

      <p>Memberships are renewed every February by end month. New memberships taken out after October 1st will be valid for one year after the following February.</p>

        <h2>Found an animal in distress?</h2>
        <p>Don’t Touch: Wait, Watch, Call!</p>

        <p>
          For most people, helping wildlife in distress is a natural reaction.
          Indeed, if you see an animal that appears sick, injured, or orphaned,
          intervention may be necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before attempting a rescue, please call the MARS helpline at (250)
          337-2021.
        </p>

        <p>
          MARS wildlife rehabilitators will assess the situation and determine
          the best course of action. Our qualified staff and volunteers tend to
          600 wildlife emergencies each year so they are very experienced and
          happy to help you.

        <h2>Capturing and Containing Wildlife</h2>

        <p>
          If a rescue is necessary, injured wild birds can be rounded up and
          captured using a towel, blanket, or piece of clothing. Place the towel
          over the bird, covering their head, and gently scoop them up.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mammals and birds of prey, such as owls and eagles, can be very
          dangerous to handle without prior training and experience, so please
          call MARS before you put the animal or yourself at risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have captured an animal, handle them as little as possible.
          Even if they appear calm, cuddling and human contact is extremely
          stressful to wildlife and may even kill them. Put the animal in a
          cardboard box or other container with air holes and keep them in a
          warm, dark, quiet place, away from children and pets. Never give
          wildlife food or water unless instructed by a wildlife rehabilitator.
        </p>

        <p>
          The MARS Wildlife Hospital is open 7 days a week. It is tremendously
          helpful if you can transport the animal to us, but if that isn’t
          possible please call to arrange for a volunteer to pick it up. The
          less time it takes for the animal to get here, the better its chances
          of successful rehabilitation! Remember it is illegal to keep wildlife
          in your possession for more than 24 hours.

        <h3>BABY BIRD</h3>
        <p>
          Many young birds found during the spring and summer months are in the
          process of “fledging” or leaving the nest and it’s normal for them to
          be on the ground for several days before they learn how to fly.
          Usually the fledgling’s parents are nearby and will return
          periodically to feed and protect their young. Unfortunately, many of
          these happy healthy fledglings are “kidnapped” by well-meaning members
          of the public who think they are injured!
        </p>

        <p>
          The best mother for a baby bird is its own mother, so before you
          intervene:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Observe the bird from a distance</li>
          <li>Keep curious children and pets away</li>
          <li>Watch and listen for the parents</li>
          <li>
            Determine if the baby is a nestling or fledgling (see descriptions
            below)
          </li>
          <li>Look for signs of injury, such as blood or a drooping wing</li>
          <li>Look for signs of illness, such as crusty eyes or beak</li>
          <li>
            Look for signs that the bird is orphaned, such as fly eggs on the
            feathers
          </li>
          <li>Phone MARS to speak to a wildlife rehabilitator</li>

        <h3>BAT</h3>

        <p>
          Do not assume that all bats carry rabies. While bats are a rabies
          vector species, meaning that they have the ability to carry rabies and
          spread it, the CDC has determined that only 0.5% of the entire bat
          population of BC is a carrier of the virus. Bats are nocturnal, and
          will often find odd places to roost during the day or over winter
          during hibernation,often on sides of buildings, inside patio
          umbrellas, or even inside wood piles.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>DO NOT TOUCH!</li>
          <li>Keep children and pets away from the bat at all times</li>
          <li>
            Watch for signs of injury such as broken bones or tears in the wing
            membrane
          </li>
          <li>
            If the injured bat is on the ground, place a container or box
            overtop of the bat to prevent it from leaving the area
          </li>
          <li>Phone MARS to speak to a wildlife rehabilitator</li>

        <h2>IS IT A NESTLING, FLEDGLING OR A BRANCHER?</h2>

        <img src="images/" alt="Nestlings" />
        <h5>Nestlings</h5>
        <p>
          Nestlings are baby birds that have recently hatched and are not yet
          ready to leave the nest. They are blind and naked or covered with
          short pinfeathers and some fluff. Nestlings are unable to stand up,
          hop, or perch. They are totally vulnerable and rely on mom and dad for
          food and warmth.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you find a healthy nestling on the ground, try to locate the nest
          nearby. If the nest is intact, you can put the nestling back. It is a
          myth that bird parents will abandon their babies if a human has
          handled them! Make sure to put them back in the right nest — check for
          other siblings of the same age and species. Then watch from a distance
          to make sure that the parents return within 2 hours.

        <img src="images/square-sm.png" alt="Fledglings" />
        <h5>Fledglings</h5>
        <p>
          Fledglings are baby birds that have developed enough that they are
          ready to leave the nest but cannot fly. They are almost fully
          feathered, but the tail and wing feathers are too short for flight.
          Fledglings are able to stand up and hop and are learning to perch.
          They are much more independent than nestlings but still rely on mom
          and dad for food.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you find a healthy fledgling on the ground, you can move it a short
          distance to a safer location, but otherwise please leave them alone.
          Being on the ground is a natural event – it doesn’t matter how many
          times you put fledglings back in the nest, they will jump back out.
          This is an important stage in their development, during which the
          parents will teach them how to find food and recognize predators.
          Watch from a distance to make sure that the parents return within 2
          hours.

        <img src="images/square-sm.png" alt="Branchers" />
        <h5>Branchers</h5>
        <p>
          Brancher is another term for a fledgling. Owl and other raptor
          fledglings are often called branchers because rather than jumping to
          the ground after leaving the nest, they will perch on a branch nearby.
          Like fledglings, they are still unable to fly so can be mistaken for a
          bird in distress.

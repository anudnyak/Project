          Welcome to the MARS Visitors Centre Gift Shop, where every purchase
          makes a difference in the lives of animals in need! Our shop is a
          great place to buy souvenirs; and it’s a haven for those passionate
          about conservation and wildlife rehabilitation. We carry a wide
          assortment of eco-friendly merchandise and handcrafted goods from
          Northern Vancouver Island and the surrounding area. From plush toys
          inspired by our resident animals to locally sourced artisanal crafts,
          to guides and tools for your own wildlife adventures; every item
          reflects our commitment to conservation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our knowledgeable staff and volunteers are always on hand to share
          stories about the animals we care for and the rehabilitation efforts
          underway. Beyond being a retail space, our Gift Shop serves as a vital
          source of support MARS Wildlife Rescue. With every purchase, customers
          directly contribute to the care and rehabilitation of injured and
          orphaned wildlife. Whether it’s funding medical supplies, building
          enclosures, or providing nutritious food, the proceeds from our shop
          play a crucial role in giving animals a second chance at life in the
          wild. By shopping with us, visitors not only take home meaningful
          mementos but also become valued partners in our ongoing efforts to
          protect and preserve wildlife for generations to come.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note: Food crumbs attract insects that are a constant threat to our
          taxidermy mounts so we do not sell or allow food in our exhibits hall.
          You are welcome to bring a lunch to eat outside at one of our picnic
          tables or benches. Please pack out what you bring in.

        <h2>Invasive Plant Removal Tool Lending Library</h2>

        <p>
          Our lending library was made possible by a generous grant from the
          Comox Valley Community Foundation. Why is it important to remove and
          replace aggressive non-native plants? Invasives such blackberries,
          broom, holly, and ivy outcompete native plant species, decreasing
          habitat and biodiversity of native flora and fauna.
        </p>

        <p>
          Local stewardship groups, including the team at MARS, put time and
          energy into removing invasive plants and replacing them with native
          species.

          <p>Total weight: ~14 lbs</p>
          <p>Height: 48″</p>
          <p>Jaw capacity: 2″</p>
          <p>
            Minimum pull ratio: 12:1 (eg. apply 10 lbs to end of handle, and 120
            lbs of pulling force is applied to plant)
          </p>
          <p>Quantity available: 4</p>
          <p>
            This tool will remove most woody-stemmed plants from paper thin up
            to 2” in diameter. The BigFoot increases the platform foot print and
            leverage while resisting sinking into soil and adding stability.
            Great for sandy, rocky, or super-soft soil conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Convenient features: automatic opening clog-free jaws, comfortable

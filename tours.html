        <p>
          MARS has much to show you. With the ever-growing need, we are very
          grateful to our community members who support our efforts to save
          wildlife patients. Please pre-book your tour, and help MARS help
          wildlife, one patient at a time.

        <h3>Planning Your Tour</h3>

        <p>
          Plan to be at MARS for 1 1/2 hours. The outdoor portion of the tour is
          about 45 minutes, then a 10 minute visit with an ambassador bird and
          handler, then as long as you wish to explore the gift shop and indoor
          exhibits hall.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our volunteer guide will greet you at the Visitor Centre to check you
          in. You’ll hear the stories of our animal patients and the skilled,
          compassionate care they receive at our hospital. You’ll view
          recovering Bald Eagles in their impressive two-story flight pen.
          You’ll visit our non-releasable ambassador owls, eagles, and albino
          crows, and meet one of our birds up-close with a handler. Our
          comfortable trails pass through gardens and wilder spaces with native
          plants. Our friendly guides give you, your family, and guests a visit
          to remember. Finally, you’ll wrap up your experience with an
          opportunity to explore our gift shop and indoor wildlife exhibits hall
          to learn and experience more.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are welcome to take pictures throughout your tour. Our flight pen
          has ports for long lens cameras. Tour guides and bird handlers are
          always happy to help you get good photos of your family and friends
          visiting MARS. Photographs of wildlife in our care must not be used
          for commercial purposes without permission. Please share your photos
          and story of your experience on Google Reviews, Facebook, Instagram,
          or in a review on TripAdvisor.

          on a virtual field trip to MARS? Learn about birds and mammals, the
          obstacles they face, and how they have adapted to survive. Find out
          what you can do when you find an injured animal and ways you can help
          wildlife. Join Warren Warttig, a biologist and our Man from MARS, as
          he takes you on a trip to the wild side. Contact us, below.

          or diurnal.

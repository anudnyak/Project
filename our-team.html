      <h3>Warren Warttig</h3>
      <p>PRESIDENT</p>
      <p>
        Warren joined the MARS Board of Directors and began volunteering as a
        wildlife caregiver in 2002, shortly after attending a MARS open house.
        By 2003 he became president of the board and he hasn’t looked back
        since.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he was in his teens, Warren started working in construction and
        forestry. Warren is a Registered Professional Biologist with the BC
        College of Applied Biology. He has a BSc in Biology and a Diploma in
        Forest Resources Management.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1999, Warren was presented the award for excellence in Coastal Forest
        Ecosystem Restoration, and in 2002 he accepted the BC Ministers Award
        for a society he helped found and manage based in Ucluelet. In 2011, he
        was granted the Bill Young Award for Excellence in Integrated Forest
        Resource Management, and in 2020, the Campbell River Mirror Animal
        Ambassador Local Hero Award.
      </p>

      <h3>Pearl McKenzie</h3>
      <p>VICE-PRESIDENT</p>
      <p>
        After starting a community legal information and advocacy offi ce in the
        early 1980s in North Vancouver, most of Pearl’s work life was dedicated
        to law reform activities to protect the rights of people. After a Snowy
        Owl led Pearl to MARS, she joined the board of directors in January
        2006.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up in a rural area, like most kids of her time, Pearl spent
        every possible moment outside. Just beyond the door was this fascinating
        and vibrant world of plants and forests fi lled with the sound of bird
        calls and insects buzzing, leaving her with a lifelong feeling of
        connectedness to nature and a need for wildness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pearl enjoys collaborating with the other volunteers in the MARS Visitor
        Centre to create similar “wild” adventures for today’s children and
        working at any task that keeps MARS running smoothly.

      <img src="images/square-sm.png" alt="Nicole Booth" />
      <p>TREASURER</p>
      <p>
        Nicole joined MARS and began volunteering as a wildlife caregiver in
        2018, shortly after attending a MARS open house. She quickly became
        enthralled with the wildlife the hospital dealt with and the variety of
        new skills she learned as a caregiver, going on to obtain her Basic
        Wildlife Rehabilitation Certifi cate and pursuing further continuing
        education in the fi eld. She joined the Board of Directors in 2023 and
        became Treasurer in 2024, continuing to be a Mentor and Rehabilitation
        Assistant in the wildlife hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nicole has worked in the property and casualty insurance industry since
        1998, but has always had a passion for animals. She is deeply involved
        with dog training, in both obedience and agility, and volunteers time as
        a trainer for a local agility club. Her interest in training aligns her
        with the education side of MARS as well and she is a member of the
        Ambassador Bird Committee.

      <h3>Therisa Lowe</h3>
      <p>SECRETARY</p>
      <p>
        Therisa’s fi rst experience with MARS was many years ago when she was
        directed to the hospital by a friend for help with some ducklings that
        were unexpectedly in her care due to a reckless driver. Relieved that
        there was a refuge for these ducklings in need, and impressed with the
        kindness and skills of the volunteers, Therisa knew that one day she
        wanted to be able to give back to MARS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being an avid proponent of animal rights and wildlife conservation,
        Therisa has always been passionate about nature and wildlife. With 20
        years of combined volunteer management experience and as a previous
        board member for multiple non-profi t organizations, Therisa is thrilled
        to have the opportunity to serve with the MARS Board of Directors since
        2019.

      <img src="images/square-sm.png" alt="Darlene Banerd" />
      <p>DIRECTOR AT LARGE</p>
      <p>
        Darlene has been with MARS since the spring of 2016. She is a retired
        registered nurse, currently volunteering as a wildlife caregiver at the
        MARS Wildlife Hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having been raised on a farm in Saskatchewan, it was instilled in her to
        respect and appreciate all living creatures (except grasshoppers!).
        Darlene feels that being part of the team at MARS has been most
        rewarding and in 2019 she joined the board of directors. Her role with
        the board is to represent the wildlife caregivers.

      <img src="images/square-sm.png" alt="Linda Hawk" />
      <h3>Linda Hawk</h3>
      <p>DIRECTOR AT LARGE</p>
      <p>
        Linda was raised on a farm and has always loved to spend time outdoors
        with the dogs and cats. After a career in the public service as a busy
        and stressed out executive, she and her partner came to the Comox Valley
        to retire and enjoy doing things they never had enough time for. For
        Linda, this included fi nding a way to help animals – something she has
        been looking to do since a young age.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she saw an Ambassador bird at one of the local events, she knew
        MARS might be a good fi t. Linda has been a volunteer wildlife caregiver
        since January 2022 and also did some guiding with the Visitor Centre
        over the spring and summer. She joined the board of directors in October
        2022. While the baby racoons have become her favourite wild furry
        critters, she is in awe of the raptors. With a name like “Hawk”, you
        kind of have to be!

    <h3>Lynda Hodgkinson</h3>
    <p>DIRECTOR AT LARGE</p>
    <p>Lynda has been an animal lover and rescuer as long as she can remember. She has been involved with MARS since 2000, when she was trained as a wildlife caregiver by MARS founder, Maj Birch. Since becoming both a member and a volunteer, she has learned much about wildlife and their habitat, how humans impact both, and what we can do to lessen the damage we cause.</p>
    <p>As a member of the board of directors, Lynda has all aspects of MARS at heart, and as chair of the special events committee, she works with other committee members to fi nd ways to raise the funds to carry on the day-to-day operation of our wildlife hospital. She is also administrator of the MARS Facebook page, where she does a fantastic job updating our followers and supporters on both patients and events at MARS!</p>

        <h3>Ginny Simpson</h3>
        <p>DIRECTOR AT LARGE</p>
        <p>Ginny has been volunteering with MARS since 2019, and a member of the board of directors since 2020.</p>
        <p>Having grown up in a large family, Ginny was often kicked outside to play along with her siblings and told not to come back until dinner was ready. Along the way she developed a love of the outdoors and all the beauty it held. It also helped that every orphaned or injured animal, whether domesticated or wild, would gravitate to her front door step, where her mom would care for them.</p>
        <p>Once retired and back on the West Coast, becoming a MARS volunteer seemed like a natural fi t. She can be found at MARS, guiding, providing virtual tours, or gathering information for the weekly Life on MARS hospital updates. Presently she is spending a lot of quality time with the albino crows, helping to prepare and train them to become ambassadors for MARS</p>

        <h3>John Turner</h3>
        <p>DIRECTOR AT LARGE</p>
        <p>John is a marine engineer by trade, and has a very interesting history, including working as a fi sheries conservation offi cer and with the Coast Guard. After his retirement in 2007, his love of wild animals spurred him to begin volunteering as a wildlife caregiver, where he started out helping MARS founder Maj Birch care for the birds. Maj saw that John was adept at troubleshooting and fi xing various household problems, so his focus quickly became repair and maintenance of the enclosures and wildlife hospital.</p>
        <p>In 2009, John joined the board of directors, and when MARS moved to its new location in Merville in 2017, he took on the role of property caretaker, overseeing the security and maintenance of our property. On top of these duties, John continues to help out with construction projects, transports, and fundraising events, such as our annual MARS Open House and garage sales.</p>

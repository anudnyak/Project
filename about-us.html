          <h3>Mars is not a zoo</h3>
          <p>
            The current medical facility is very much a hospital and the mammals
            and birds are very much patients. As far as possible, they are
            extended the same courtesies a human patient would receive because
            privacy, peace, and quiet are essential to wildlife recovery. For
            this reason, we don’t allow the general public access to our
            patients in the hospital.
          </p>
          <p>
            MARS wildlife caregivers also follow strict protocols to ensure the
            lowest level of human-wildlife interaction possible in order to
            prevent imprinting or habituation. We want wild nature to stay wild.
            Our waterfowl, deer, and racoon enclosures are not accessible to the
            public.
          </p>
          <p>
            The enclosures in the Mews (outdoor viewing area) are designed for
            the safety, security, and privacy of our resident Ambassador Birds.
            We encourage quiet observation of these birds. We ask visitors to
            understand that our raptors are not always easy to see as they will
            perch in the most secluded corner of their homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We encourage the public to help with the rescue of injured wildlife
            by bringing small species to us, or to a veterinarian. With large or
            dangerous wildlife such as Bald Eagles or Great Blue Heron, our
            trained staff and volunteers will respond.

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <img src="images/landscape-sm.png" alt="The Founders" />
        <h3>The Founders</h3>
        <p>
          MARS Wildlife Rescue founder, Mary Jane Birch, known to many as “Maj”,
          and her husband Keith were both keenly engaged in the protection and
          preservation of wildlife and habitat in the Comox Valley. Maj worked
          tirelessly to rescue, rehabilitate, and release injured wildlife,
          while Keith built cages to house them all. Maj drew people with the
          same concern for wildlife rehabilitation to work beside her as
          volunteers in the early days. It was a shared passion for both Maj and
          Keith for many years.
        </p>
        <img src="images/landscape-sm.png" alt="The Society" />
        <h3>The Society</h3>
        <p>
          Mountainaire Avian Rescue Society —still our legal name— began on
          their pretty, forested three-acre property in rural Merville, British
          Columbia. Maj applied for and received federal and provincial permits
          to rehabilitate wildlife in 1993; two years later the society was
          registered as a provincial and federal non-profi t charity. Keith died
          in 2008 after a lengthy illness. His eff orts left a legacy that
          helped MARS grow from treating 100 to 200 patients annually to over
          600 at the original location, before the planned move in 2017 to our
          new home at 1331 Williams Beach Road.
        </p>

        <h3>The Hospital and Visitor Centre</h3>
        <p>
          Maj dreamed of building a better facility on a larger property that
          could treat more birds and mammals, while also acting as an education
          centre. She wanted to teach the public—particularly young people and
          children—the importance of preserving and protecting the wildlife and
          habitat of the Comox Valley and northern Vancouver Island.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our present 11-acre property was purchased in early 2015, with the
          assistance of a substantial bequest from the Woodrow family. After
          much planning and installation of services, the new MARS Wildlife
          Hospital began receiving patients in May 2017 and our Visitor Centre
          opened in June 2019. Our volunteers and donors—individuals, community
          groups, and corporate sponsors—have helped us add treatment areas to
          our hospital, build enclosures for resident and recovering animals,
          and construct a substantial, multi-area fl ight pen for recovering
          eagles and smaller birds.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her will, Maj left a substantial bequest to MARS Wildlife Rescue to
          help her dreams along. With the continued support of the local
          community, our generous donors, and dedicated volunteers, we are
          working to fulfi ll her dreams and create a legacy for our communities
          that will ensure wildlife is protected and wild habitats are preserved
          through public education at the Visitor Centre.
        </p>
        <img src="images/landscape-sm.png" alt="The Future" />
        <h3>The Future</h3>
        <p>
          As the property improvements proceed, we are making habitat
          preservation and recovery a priority. We are providing wildlife
          corridors through the property by not adding fences which would
          prevent transit to grazing areas. From a seasonally dry pond, we have
          created wet habitat for the wild things. Our wetland area is visited
          by ducks and heron, and deer come to drink. Even our local bear
          wanders by in the evening. This area has also seen a species of
          concern, the Red-legged Frog. We had tadpoles in the pools in the
          spring of 2019 and are hopeful for their continued return. In short,
          we are trying to provide habitat to our wild neighbours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, MARS has witnessed an exponential increase in the
          number of animals and birds that come through our doors. In 2021,
          volunteers and staff tended to over 1400 patients and are expecting to
          surpass that total this year. By far the main reason for our growing
          caseload is human expansion into traditional wildlife habitats. Simply
          put, all of us are interacting with wild nature far more often than we
          used to, and MARS is seeing more patients as a result.

        <h2>A Visit from an Ambassador Bird</h2>

        <p>
          If you’re an educator, community outreach group, or organization
          putting on an event and you would like to have MARS ambassador birds
          attend, please fill out the short form below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Part of the MARS mission is to spread the word about the protection
          and preservation of wildlife and habitats on northern Vancouver Island
          and so we love it when the public — particularly young people — can
          experience our majestic hawk and owls up close, with the
          interpretative support of our bird handlers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goal is always to release sick or injured animals into the wild
          after they have recovered, but that isn’t always possible. For various
          reasons, our Ambassadors are permanent residents of MARS. They travel
          to classrooms and the wider community with a volunteer bird handler to
          act as “spokesbirds” for all wildlife.

        <h2>Planning for an Ambassador Bird Visit</h2>

        <p>
          Seeing an owl or hawk up close can be an exciting experience. A bit of
          preparation will make the encounter enjoyable for audiences while
          remaining safe and comfortable for the bird.
        </p>

        <h4>PLEASE PREPARE THE SPACE:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Fairly quiet without a lot of echo</li>
          <li>
            A place where the handler &amp; birds can have their backs to a wall
          </li>
          <li>Can be outside against trees or under shade</li>
          <li>
            A flat, stable surface for the bird’s kennel. A table is better than
            the ground
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>PLEASE PREPARE THE GROUP:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Calm bodies, calm voices, hands as still.</li>
          <li>
            Remind the audience that these are wild birds, not pets, and they
            will not be able to touch them
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes birds poop. This can be a surprise! Handlers will have
            pads to catch the cloacal fluid.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes birds “bate” or fly off the glove. This is also a
            surprise. Because the bird is attached to the handler by leather
            straps, this is more flapping than flying and doesn’t hurt the bird.
          </li>
          <li>
            Handlers love questions and also love to hear what you already know
            about wildlife and conservation.
          </li>

      <h2>Our Ambassadors</h2>

      <article>
        <p>
          Our non-releasable Ambassador Birds are living out their natural lives
          comfortably — with room service — in safe and private enclosures at
          MARS Wildlife Rescue Centre.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of the raptors who have become Ambassadors suffered devastating
          injuries that prevented them from being returned to the wild, while
          others have become habituated to humans for various reasons. All have
          found new purpose helping to educate the public about wild nature. To
          keep these raptors, MARS applied for permits and continues to meet
          government regulations for their appropriate care.

        <h3>Marlowe</h3>
        <p><strong>BARRED OWL (STRIX VARIA)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Marlowe came to MARS in the fall of 2019 after hitting a window in
          Comox in the middle of the night. The home owners found him and
          brought him to our wildlife hospital the next day. He showed many
          signs of severe head trauma, and we weren’t sure if he could even see
          properly. He showed no threat avoidance, and was extremely docile.
        </p>

        <p>
          He saw several vets who determined there was no reason Marlowe should
          not be able to see, and that it was most likely the head trauma that
          was causing him not to react to movement or oncoming threats. He
          struggled to eat for the first several months with us, and progressed
          from being force-fed, to handfed, to eventually eating on his own
          without any help from the caregivers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Marlowe has progressed a great deal since arriving with us as a
          patient, but nowhere near enough to be successfully released into the
          wild. He gets his name from Christopher Marlowe who was William
          Shakespeare’s friend, collaborator, and (at times) rival.
        </p>

        <p>
          Marlowe is a very gentle bird who was born in the spring of 2019, with
          an expected lifespan of upwards of 20 years in captivity. He typically
          weighs about 600 – 700 grams, and eats two mice a day.

            >WESTERN SCREECH OWL (MEGASCOPS KENNICOTTII MACFARLANEI)</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Lanei arrived at MARS in March 2015 from a research and captive
          breeding program for Western Screech Owls in Northern BC when he was
          about 2 years old. These birds are threatened and are protected under
          the federal Species at Risk Act. Lanei is non-releasable due to his
          inability to hunt or protect himself from predators. MARS’ late
          Ambassador Screech Owl, Otus Jr., was also from this same program.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lanei can be resistant to go to “work” and will hang upside down from
          the roof of his enclosure. But once his plans are foiled, he becomes
          very calm and enjoys having his picture taken.
        </p>

        <p>
          Western Screech owls in captivity have a life expectancy of about 15
          years. He eats one mouse each day and weighs 175 – 250 g. Lanei is a
          very quiet bird with a very sweet personality, and usually keeps his
          ear tufts down, so he often presents himself as a very well-rounded
          owl!

        <h3>Horus</h3>
        <p><strong>RED TAILED HAWK (BUTEO JAMAICENSIS)</strong></p>

        <p>
          Horus is a Red-tailed Hawk named after the falcon-headed Egyptian god
          of the same name. She was found in 2008 hanging around the Quinsam
          River Hatchery near Campbell River where she was begging for food and
          in poor physical condition. When she was approached by one of our bird
          handlers, she jumped to the glove, indicating she was imprinted to
          humans and probably raised in captivity.
        </p>

        <p>
          When she was brought to MARS, she was emaciated and suffered from
          bumblefoot, a type of infection which prevented her from bending her
          toes to perch or catch prey. MARS developed a cream to cure her foot
          issue. She is also prone to feather damage as she may not have had a
          “Mom” to teach her feather maintenance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Horus is a healthy older bird whose dramatic nature appeals to all
          visitors. She is at least 14 years old with a life expectancy of 20
          years. She eats half a quail each day and weighs about 1.3 kg.

        <h3>Humpty</h3>
        <p><strong>BALD EAGLE (HALIAEETUS LEUCOCEPHALUS)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Humpty was a pre-fledgling found at the base of a tree and thought to
          be dead. Five days later he was found to be moving and MARS was called
          in for rescue. As he had suffered a great fall, his finders named him
          Humpty.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon admission he was found to be suffering from severe dehydration
          and emaciation. His tail feathers were missing, but slowly grew back
          within his first year at MARS. It is also believed that he has some
          mental deficit due to his early injuries. He seldom vocalizes and his
          flight remains uncertain. His diet consists of poultry, fish and deer
          meat and he weighs about 3-3.5 kg.

        <h3>Hyacinth</h3>
        <p><strong>BALD EAGLE (HALIAEETUS LEUCOCEPHALUS)</strong></p>

        <p>
          Hyacinth fell from her nest as a pre-fledgling when her nest fell
          apart. MARS was called and went by boat to the site at Hyacinth Cove
          on Quadra Island to rescue her.
        </p>

        <p>
          She suffered multiple fractures in her right wing that were too close
          to the shoulder to be pinned so her wing was taped for 4 weeks. When
          another eagle accidentally bumped into her later, the wing was
          re-fractured. It eventually did heal but has a slight curve in the
          humerus so she is unable to “soar like an eagle”.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hy is very vocal and likes to greet her handlers when they enter her
          enclosure. She is fairly gentle in spite of her size and gets along
          well with Humpty, her permanent roommate. She also seems to enjoy the
          company of other eagle patients when they are housed together. Her
          diet consists of poultry, fish and deer meat and she weighs about 3.5
          – 4.0 kg.

        <h3>Nimpkish &amp; Kokish</h3>
        <p><strong>AMERICAN CROW (CORVUS BRACHYRHYNCHOS)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Siblings Nimpkish and Kokish arrived as juvenile birds in the summer
          of 2020. Finders reported that they were being aggressively mobbed by
          other crows. Kokish (female, on the right) had a greenstick fracture
          of the tibiotarsus, a leg bone. Her brother Nimpkish was brought to
          our hospital the next day as the attacks continued.
        </p>

        <p>
          These distinctive birds are albinos, meaning they do not possess the
          pigments that would make their feathers, skin, beak, and eyes black.
          This genetic condition also results in very weak eyesight, extreme
          sensitivity to light, and poor depth perception, making it difficult
          for them to find food and protect themselves. Their feathers are
          easily damaged as they are missing the melanin that contributes both
          colour and strength. Because their feathers reflect light, albino
          birds have difficulty staying warm in winter. All these factors lead
          to a veterinarian determining that the pair would have the best
          quality of life by becoming Ambassadors at MARS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their names reflect their origin: these crows were born in the
          traditional territory of the ‘Namgis First Nation on northern
          Vancouver Island, which encompasses the Nimpkish and Kokish
          watersheds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nimpkish and Kokish have distinctive behaviours and a fascinating
          relationship. Please note: when temperatures fall below -10°C, these
          birds are moved into the hospital and aren’t available for viewing
          during tours.

        <h3>Sawyer (2014-2021)</h3>
        <p><strong>NORTHERN SAW_SHET OWL (AEGOLIUS ACADICUS)</strong></p>

        <p>
          Sawyer had been with MARS since August of 2014 when he sustained
          damage to his right wing, possibly due to a cat attack. The damage to
          his wing was severe and the entire wing was surgically amputated.
          Because of his injuries he could not be released, so was adopted into
          the MARS ambassador family.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2016 Sawyer’s right eye became inflamed and even though it was
          treated with daily eye drops, it did not heal. In September 2017 he
          underwent surgical removal of his eye.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a MARS ambassador, our little one-winged, one-eyed owl was among
          our fiercest birds. His small size and oversized personality made a
          lasting impression on all our visitors, young and old.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sawyer’s job was to educate the public about owls and other wildlife,
          and help visitors feel a connection to the natural world. In the six
          years he spent as part of this program, he made an impact on the lives
          of hundreds of people of different ages from all over the Valley and
          beyond. He passed peacefully at MARS in late January 2021 due to old
          age, surrounded by those who loved him.

        <p>
          Otus Jr. was the offspring of one of our previous ambassador owls who
          had participated in a captive breeding program for the threatened
          Western Screech Owl. Once the program was no more, Otus and his
          roommate, Lanei, were sent to MARS to live out their lives because
          they would not be able to fend for themselves in the wild.

          Otus joined the MARS family in 2014 and became a mainstay of our
          education program. He visited local classrooms, attended community
          events, and did many on-site presentations during his lifetime. He was
          always content to get out and sit on the glove of a handler, many of
          whom shared an incredible bond with him. Handlers would often find
          Otus with his ear tufts up, ready to have a chat when they entered his
          enclosure to catch him up for his working day. He had a huge impact on
          all of us at MARS and had many fans out in the community.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the end stages of his life, Otus became very ill with severe
          internal infections. After visits to several different vets and a
          number of tests that showed an increasingly poor prognosis, we decided
          that humane euthanasia was the kindest option for little Otus. He
          passed away at MARS in early February 2021, surrounded by those who
          loved and cared for him.

        <h3>Shakespeare (2005-2023)</h3>
        <p><strong>BARRED OWL (STRIX VARIA)</strong></p>

        <p>
          Shakespeare was hit by a car in 2003. He lost his left eye, fractured
          his beak and sternum, and had hearing loss on one side. He spent a
          year and a half in rehabilitation at the Orphaned Wildlife
          Rehabilitation Society in Delta, British Columbia (O.W.L.). His
          injuries would prevent him from fending for himself in the wild so it
          was not possible to release him.
        </p>

        <p>
          Originally, Shakespeare was adopted by MARS as a foster parent to
          younger Barred Owls but he wasn’t very good in this role. He started
          training to become an Ambassador bird in 2006 and made his first
          public appearance six months later. He could often be heard calling to
          local wild owls late in the day, even making “howler monkey” calls on
          occasion. His diet was mostly quail and mice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the 17 years he spent at MARS, Shakey touched the lives of
          thousands of people, helped with many events and school presentations,
          and bonded strongly with several of his handlers. He made a huge
          impact on the community during his time with us, and we are so
          grateful he was able to live out his life happily with us here at
          MARS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shakespeare developed liver disease and lung issues towards the end of
          his life and was humanely euthanized in March of 2023. He passed in
          the arms of his favourite handler.

        <p>We will miss you, Shakespeare. Fly high and free once again!</p>

        <h3>Brinley (2004-2023)</h3>
        <p><strong>GREAT HORNED OWL (BUBO VIRGINIANUS)</strong></p>

        <p>
          Brinley was in full adult plumage when she was hit by a car in the
          Lower Mainland in 2005. Her right wing was so badly damaged that part
          of it had to be amputated. She was initially at the Vancouver
          Aquarium, then The Raptors in Duncan. As a non-flighted bird she
          needed a more suitable home for the long-term and thankfully, Maj and
          the team at MARS welcomed her in as an ambassador.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jo, one of our caregivers, said: “Brinley was a force to be reckoned
          with. She chose whom to connect with and was the dominant partner in
          the relationship. Brinley lost the ability to be the apex predator of
          the night sky but never lost the attitude.” All of those that had the
          honour of having a progressing relationship with Brinley saw it as an
          immense privilege.
        </p>

        <p>
          Great horned owls are known to have incredibly strong feet but those
          that worked with her on the glove claim she was the gentlest bird. She
          touched many lives while attending events and presentations, and
          became a regular to visit on our ambassador tour after her retirement.
          Her presence was truly amazing.
        </p>

        <p>
          We at MARS have had the absolute pleasure of working with Brinley,
          such an incredible species and personality. May she enjoy her final
          freedom in the skies.
